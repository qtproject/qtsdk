1.  Introduction to installer scripts

    The folder release-tools of Qt 5's qtrepotools module contains
    scripts to generate desktop installers based on the Qt
    Installer-Framework. Example configuration templates are provided
    but actual content that is to be installed needs to be generated
    separately.

    For detailed usage of the Qt Installer-Framework itself please refer to the
    Qt Installer-Framework documentation.

    The scripts can be used to create offline installers or online installers.
    For online installers you need a dedicated server to host the repositories.


2.  General requirements

    Make sure you have the following tools installed:
    - Python 2.6 or 2.7
    - Win: win32api python module
    - 7z

    Build requirements:
    - Linux/Mac: gcc toolchain
    - Windows: MinGW/Visual Studio toolchain

3.  Quick start

    The 'create_installer.py' only generates the installer itself and wraps the
    content inside. The actual installable content must be built separately
    and archived in 7z format for the installer.

    Let's assume that you want to create Qt 5 Beta offline installer that
    contains only Qt5 source and binary package.

    You should have the following packages built separately:
        - qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.0.0.tar.gz i.e. the source pacakge
        - qt5_all.7z                                i.e. the Qt5 binary package (e.g. msvc2010 64-bit)

    Let's assume that you want to create the installer for Windows. Also let's
    assume that you will put the qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.0.0.tar.gz and
    qt5_all.7z somewhere on your local file system.
    E.g.
        c:\my_qt5_builds\qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.0.0.tar.gz
        c:\my_qt5_builds\qt5_all.7z


    Open '/configurations/win_x86_beta' and see the following items:

    (1)

        [src.qt.500_beta]
        archive_uri:         # This is the uri where the script will try to download this package
        package_strip_dirs:  # Strip this many unnecessary directories from the beginning of this package before creating the installer. See detailed explanation later in this document.
        archive_name:        # Needed for online installers. Leave as it is.

        -> So this part should look like this:

        [src.qt.500_beta]
        archive_uri:            c:\my_qt5_builds\qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.0.0.tar.gz
        package_strip_dirs:     1
        target_install_dir:     /
        rpath_target:
        archive_name:           qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.0.0.7z

    (2)

        [desktop.500_beta.msvc2010_64]
        archive_uri:            # This is the uri where the script will try to download this package
        package_strip_dirs:     # Strip this many unnecessary directories from the beginning of this package before creating the installer. See detailed explanation later in this document.
        archive_name:           # Needed for online installers. Leave as it is.

        -> So this part should look like this:

        [desktop.500_beta.msvc2010_64]
        archive_uri:            c:\my_qt5_builds\qt5_all.7z
        package_strip_dirs:     5
        archive_name:           msvc2010_64_all.7z


        Note! This example assumes that you don't want to include
        32-bit msvc2012 Qt binaries so delete the whole section:

        [qt.sdk.desktop.500_beta.msvc2010]


        Now you are ready the create the installer with the following command (on windows):

        > python create_installer.py -f win_x86_beta --offline --devmode

        Explanations:

            - win_x86_beta  i.e. the main configuration file you just edited
            - offline       creates offline installer
            - devmode       builds Qt Installer-Framework and static Qt4.8 libraries for it on the fly

        Depending on the speed of your computer the installer executable will
        be generated on the scripts root directory (30-60 minutes).


3.1 Offline installers for different platforms

    To create a standalone offline installer use:

    Linux:      python create_installer.py linux -f linux_x86_32_beta --offline --devmode
                OR
                python create_installer.py linux -f linux_x86_64_beta --offline --devmode

    Mac:        python create_installer.py mac -f mac_x86_64_beta --offline --devmode

    Windows:    python create_installer.py -f win_x86_beta --offline --devmode


    output:
        - SDK installer executable will be generated into the scripts root directory.
        - "repositories" directory will be generated into the scripts root directory



4   Detailed explanations about the internals

    Definitions:

        Component:  One component in install tree. E.g. 'qt.sdk.desktop'. Best
                    example can be found from existing installers (Qt SDK) where
                    you can see the "install-tree" where each 'node' represents
                    one component.

        Package:    In this context the 'package' refers to data content. Usually
                    in 7z format. One 'component' can contain multiple packages.

4.1 Configuration files

    Main configuration files reside in the root of '/Configurations'.
    Example main configuration files are:

        '/Configurations/linux_x86_32_beta'
        '/Configurations/linux_x86_64_beta'
        '/Configurations/mac_x86_32_beta'
        '/Configurations/win_x86_32_beta'

    The main configuration files can include other configuration files.
    This approach can be used if the number of installable components is large
    and you want to modularize the configuration files.

        '/Configurations/all-os'  directory can contain configuration files common for all platforms.
        '/Configurations/linux'   directory contains linux platform specific configuration files
        '/Configurations/mac'     directory contains mac platform specific configuration files
        '/Configurations/windows' directory contains windows platform specific configuration files

    Sub-configuration files contain only installable package releated information.
    Main configuratio file contain all the rest required information required for installer creation.

4.2 Package templates.

    Directory '/Configurations/pkg' contain the package templates.
    Example listing:

        com.qt
        com.qt.desktop
        com.qt.desktop.qt
        com.qt.desktop.qt.500
        com.qt.desktop.qt.500.gcc
        com.qt.src
        com.qt.src.500

    Each template has directory called 'meta'. This directory contains at least
    'package.xml' file that contains metadata about specified component.
    Other file commonly seen in the same directory is 'installscript.qs' yet
    optional. E.g.

    '/Configurations/pkg/com.qt.desktop.qt.500.gcc/meta/package.xml'
    '/Configurations/pkg/com.qt.desktop.qt.500.gcc/meta/installscript.xml'

    Note! For each item in the installer GUI 'install-tree' a template needs to exist.

    package.xml contains metadata and description fields for the specific component.
    installscript.qs can be used if the component installation requires some specific
    steps. E.g. Qt binary patching operation is triggered from here during installation phase.
    Please refer to Installer-Framework documentation for detailed instructions:  http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtifw-1.2/index.html


4.3 Main configuration file explained

    The syntax complies to Python config file format.
    See http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html

    Brief explanation about the syntax:

        [Section_name]
        key1: value
        key2: value
        keyx: value

    The build script expects to find the following sections and values from the
    main configuration file:


        [PackageNamespace]
        name:                   qt.sdk                                          # Sections starting with this name are identified as components to be installed. E.g. [qt.sdk.desktop.500_beta.msvc2010]
                                                                                # The script will search through all included configuration files (main and sub) and check if the section starts with
                                                                                # 'qt.sdk' (in this example). If the condition is met then parse the key/value pairs under that section and load the
                                                                                # corresponding template from templates directory, e.g. '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.desktop.500_beta.msvc2010'
        [PlatformIdentifier]
        identifier:             linux                                           # Check for sub-configuration files from '/configurations/linux'. E.g. on Windows replace this with 'windows'

        [ArchiveRemoteLocation.some_server_nickname_here]
        base_url:               http://<server_address_here>/packages/          # If you choose to put pre-build contents on some remote location (e.g. you have CI system that builds the
                                                                                # packages regularly) you can define the 'base_url' part here.
        base_path:                                                              # Will be deprecated. Do not use. Leave it empty.

        # for testing purposes
        [PackageIgnoreList]
        packages:               foo.bar, foo.bar2, foo.bar3                     # E.g. if you choose to make test installer build and want to exclude one component put the component name here
                                                                                # e.g. qt.sdk.desktop.500_beta.gcc_64

        [ExtraPackageConfigurationFiles]
        file_list:                                                              # if you have sub-configuration files e.g. in '/configurations/linux' directory, put the name of the file here.
                                                                                # multiple files can be included when separated by comma

        [OfflinePackageExcludeList]
        package_list:                                                           # if you create offline installer but still want to drop out some components which should reside in online repository
                                                                                # instead list them here, separated by comma. Only if you have server back end to support online repositories.

        [SdkUpdateRepository]
        repository_url_release: http://../qt5repository/linux/x64/online_qt5sdk_repo    # when creating online installer put the base url here where the installer expects to find the Updates.xml
        repository_url_rnd:     http://../qt5repository/linux/x64/online_qt5sdk_repo    # same as above, use this if you have dedicated RnD server for internal testing. Then the installer script
                                                                                        # must be started with additional 'testclient' command line argument

        [TargetArchitechture]
        instruction_set:        x86_64                                          # Currently used only for installer filename generation

        [ConfigDir]
        template_name:          config_qt5                                      # Script tries to locate config templates from directory '/configurations/config_qt5/'
                                                                                # This directory contains bitmaps and general installer resources.

        [ConfigXml]
        template_name:          config.xml.template.linux.qt5-beta              # Filename for the chosen config.xml template to be used. E.g. if your [PlatformIdentifier] is linux then
                                                                                # the script will try to locate the file from '/configurations/linux/'

        [WorkingDirectories]
        packages_dir:           pkg_beta                                        # The script needs the location where to load the templates. Now it points to:
                                                                                # '/configurations/pkg_beta'

        [InstallerFrameworkTools]                                               # If you choose to use pre-build Installer-Framework binaries & tools you can give the full package url here
        name:                   ifwt                                            # but it is preferred to use the command line argument 'devmode' so the script will build the Installer-Framework
        package_url:            http://<server_address_here>/packages/.../installer-framework-build-linux-64bit.7z
        version:                1.2.0



    Note! So far no installable components have been defined yet! In the example
    Qt 5 Beta main configuration files the components are defined in the main
    configuration file as well. This approach can be used but when the amount
    of installable components grow it is recommended to split components in
    specific sub-configuration files which you include in this main configuration
    file. Put the sub-configuration files under directory defined in [PlatformIdentifier],
    e.g '/configurations/linux'


4.4 Defining components to be include in the installer

    Example component 1:

    [qt.sdk.desktop.500_beta.msvc2010_64]                                       # Name must start with 'qt.sdk' as defined in [PackageNamespace]
    archives:               archive_1, archive_2, foobar                        # List of archives to be included in this component
    target_install_base:    /Desktop/Qt/5.0.0-beta/msvc2010_64                  # The archives shall be extracted in this directory on user's computer (under <SDK_ROOT>)
    version:                5.0.0                                               # This version will be put into corresponding package.xml <version> field
    version_tag:            %QT_VERSION%                                        # If the package.xml contains <version>%QT_VERSION%</version> then the version number will get replaced automatically
    package_default:        true                                                # Will make the component shown as 'default' component in installer. Values: 'true', 'false', 'script'
    [archive_1]                                                                 # Defines one archive to be included for this component. This was included in the 'archives' list above
    archive_uri:            c:\my_qt5_builds\qt5_all.7z                         # Where to download the package.
    package_strip_dirs:     5                                                   # If your 'qt5_all.7z' containst dir structure you need to rip out e.g. '\temp\work\build\...' you can rip out
                                                                                # these by telling how many directories to strip from the beginning
    target_install_dir:     /                                                   # Normally leave as '/'. This path is appended into 'target_install_base' and the content is installed in this dir
    rpath_target:                                                               # Only for Unix like systems where RPath needs to be patched. If used (not empty) the script will patch the RPath
                                                                                # in executables and libraries found in the archive. E.g. on Linux the value here would be '/lib' where the
                                                                                # Qt libraries reside. The script will patch the RPath value to use relative paths.
    archive_name:           msvc2010_64_all.7z                                  # Only for online installers. This is the name for the package residing on online repositores (on server).
    [archive_2]                                                                 # Another archive to be included in for the component
    archive_uri:            c:\my_qt5_builds\cats.7z
    package_strip_dirs:     3
    target_install_dir:     /
    rpath_target:
    archive_name:           cats.7z
    [foobar]                                                                    # Yet another archive to be included in for the component
    archive_uri:            c:\my_qt5_builds\dogs.7z
    package_strip_dirs:
    target_install_dir:     /
    rpath_target:
    archive_name:           dogs.7z


    So this arbitrary example described one installable component that included three different archives.
    E.g. you might have component 'profiling tools' denoted as 'qt.sdk.misc.tools.profiling' and that installable
    component could include e.g. two archives 'mem leak analyzer' and 'heap profiler' etc. etc.


    Things to remember and notice!

    1) Each used component [qt.sdk.XXXXXXXXXX] must have corresponding template under
       'packages_dir' that was defined in the main configuration file.
       E.g. for this arbitrary component you should have
            '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.XXXXXXXXXX'
            '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.XXXXXXXXXX/meta'
            '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.XXXXXXXXXX/meta/package.xml'
            '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.XXXXXXXXXX/meta/installscript.qs' (optional)

    2) You can define 'empty' components without any data. You can just define
       the section name:
            [qt.sdk.YYYYYYYYYY]
       and the YYYYYYYYYY will be shown as one 'node' in the installer's 'install tree'.
       The corresponding template is always needed!
            '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.YYYYYYYYYY'
            '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.YYYYYYYYYY/meta'
            '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.YYYYYYYYYY/meta/package.xml'

    3) The Qt Installer-Framework expects the packages to be in 7z format.
       However the script can manage source packages in .zip or in .tar.gz format
       (it will repackage those).


4.5 Package look-up order

    There are three possibilities where you can put the archives to be included in
    the installer. The script will try to locate the archive in the following
    order:

    - local file system, absolute path
    - archive under templates 'data' folder
    - remote location

    (1) Absolute file path usage:

        [archive_2]
        archive_uri:            c:\my_qt5_builds\cats.7z

        TODO: In theory the script should be able to fetch packages from mapped
              network drives but this is not tested.

    (2) Put archive under templates directory. E.g.

        '/configurations/pkg_beta/qt.sdk.YYYYYYYYYY/data/icons.7z

        This can be handy if you have some small archive that can reside
        in version controll as well. In this case the 'archive_uri' is:

            [archive_2]
            archive_uri:            icons.7z

    (3) Archives on remote location

        E.g. in win_x86_beta main configuration file first notice the following:

            [ArchiveRemoteLocation.some_server_nickname_here]
            base_url:               http://<server_address_here>/packages/

        Then define the archive uri as follows:

            [archive_2]
            archive_uri:            /qt/5.0.0/cats.7z

        -->

        base_url + archive_uri = http://<server_address_here>/packages/qt/5.0.0/windows_vs2010_64/cats.7z

        In the main configuration file you can define remote location. 'The base_url'
        defines the base address under which it tries to locate packages.


        Advanced:

            You can define multiple remote locations as follows:

                [ArchiveRemoteLocation.helsinki]
                base_url:               http://<server_address_here>/packages/

                [ArchiveRemoteLocation.oslo]
                base_url:               http://<server_address_here>/packages/

                [ArchiveRemoteLocation.berlin]
                base_url:               http://<server_address_here>/packages/

            Now you can define dedicated server for the specified component:

                [qt.sdk.desktop.500_beta.foobar]
                archives:               foobar
                target_install_base:    /foobar
                version:                1.2.3
                version_tag:            %VERSION%
                package_default:        true
                [foobar]
                archive_uri:            /foobar.7z
                package_strip_dirs:     5
                target_install_dir:     /
                rpath_target:
                archive_name:           foobar.7z


5.  Building Installer-Framework itself

    When you launch the 'create_installer.py' with command line argument
    'devmode' the script will build the Qt Installer-Framework and static
    Qt libraries for it on the fly.

    For each platform (Linux, Windows, Mac) there is corresponding
    'installer-framework' configuration file:

        '/configurations/linux/installer-framework'
        '/configurations/windows/installer-framework'
        '/configurations/mac/installer-framework'

    This configuration file describes:

        - Where to download the sources for Installer-Framework and Qt
        - What version of Installer-Framework and Qt
        - How they are built

    When using the 'devmode' the main script 'create_installer.py' uses
    the 'bld_ifw_tools.py' script to build the Installer-Framework.

    'create_installer.py'
            |
            --> 'bld_ifw_tools.py'
                    |
                    --> 'bld_ifw_tools_impl.py'
                                |
                                ==> [Installer-Framework libraries & tools]
            |                                       ᶺ
    (read configuration files)                      |
            |                                       |
    (build/package content for installer)           |
            |                                       |
    <create installer> <----------------------------
            |
            v
    'installer executable'

5.1 Generating pre-built Installer-Framework libraries

    Note! The following information is useful only if you choose to use
          pre-built Installer-Framework libraries. This approach can be
          used if you wish to save installer creation time in the long run.

          Otherwise it is recommended to use the 'devmode' command line option
          to create the installer.

    Usage:

        > python bld_ifw_tools.py linux

        or

        > python bld_ifw_tools.py windows

        or

        > python bld_ifw_tools.py mac


    Explanations:

    'bld_ifw_tools.py' builds the Installer-Framework. It expects to find
    file 'installer-framework' under '/configurations/<platform>' where the
    platform is linux/windows/mac.

    If you open the 'installer-framework' file you can find e.g.:

        installer_framework_archive_name:       installer-framework-build-win.7z

    When the build has completed you should find the above mentioned .7z archive
    from the scripts root dir and that contains the IFW libraries and tools.


    You can put this archive e.g. on server share and then define the following
    in you main configuration file, e.g. in 'win_x86_beta'

        [InstallerFrameworkTools]
        package_url:            http://<server_address_here>/.../installer-framework-build-win.7z


    Now you can run the 'create_installer.py' script without 'devmode' option
    as now the script will download the pre-built libraries from the URL
    you have defined and use them instead of building them from sources.
    This will save installer creation time considerably if you start installer
    creation from scratch every time.
